# MusicJunkies-Backend

MusicJunkies is a responsive music review/ recommendation web application similar to letterboxd which is for movies. Our application allows users to review and keep track of their favorite music albums and also view other user profiles. 
It is a portal for music lovers to review and recommend music. 
This repository implements the backend part of the portal using Node, Mongo and Express. 
This project is done as part of Software Production Engineering Course.
